The Angler exploit kit is a pre-packaged toolkit sold on the dark web that criminals use to distribute malware. 

With an exploit kit handy, there is no need to find  bugs, develop exploits 

With an exploit kit, criminals do

Criminals who buy exploit kits do not need to find bugs, develop exploits from them, set up or take over web servers to host the exploits or find ways to lure victims to these booby-trapped web sites. 

Likewise, the exploit kit authors don’t have to worry about writing malware; they don’t have to run servers to keep track of infected computers, or to collect money from individual victims; they don’t have to get involved in exfiltrating stolen data, or selling that data on.


Angler is a drive-by download, which means victims are redirected to a website that hosts the exploit kit. There are thousands of websites booby-trappe with Angler landing-pages. 



Angler often uses freshly registered domains and domain shadowing to


When a vicitm visits a booby-trapped site - known as a landing page - they're redirected to a website that hosts the Angler exploit kit. Here, Angler attempts to systematically exploit the victim with a list of known vulnerabilities(in Flash, Silverlight, Java, JavaScript...) and deliver the payload. 
	
	if  Flash is installed
    		try exploit #1
        	if exploit works, deliver payload
        	else try exploit #2
    if JavaScript is installed 
        	try exploit #1
            ...
    else give up
    
When a vulnerability can be exploited, Angler typically downloads the payload from a third web page.
