The Angler exploit kit is a pre-packaged toolkit sold on the dark web that criminals use to distribute malware. 

With an exploit kit, would-be attackers no longer need to find bugs in software; develop ways to exploit them; set up or take over web servers to host these exploits; and lure victims to booby-trapped websites known as landing pages. Likewise, exploit kit makers do not need to write malware; or keep track of infected computers; or collect money from victims; or exfiltrate and sell stolen.

When a vicitm visits a booby-trapped site they're redirected to a website that hosts the Angler exploit kit. Here, Angler attempts to systematically exploit the victim with a list of known vulnerabilities (in Flash, Silverlight, Java, JavaScript...) and deliver the payload. 
	
	if  Flash is installed
    		try exploit #1
        	if exploit works, deliver payload
        	else try exploit #2
    if JavaScript is installed 
        	try exploit #1
            ...
    else give up
 

When a vulnerability can be exploited, Angler typically downloads the payload from a third web page. Although this can be any type of malware - like a password stealer or adware - ransomeware now makes up a significant portion of payloads.
