The Angler exploit kit is a pre-packaged toolkit of malicious web pages that can be bought or leased on the dark web and used to distribute malware. 

Exploit kits like Angler provide criminals with a ready-made way to deliver malware. Angler is a drive-by download, which means targets are redirected to a website that hosts the exploit kit. There are thousands of websites booby-trappe with Angler landing-pages. 

In other words, if you have some shiny new malware – ransomware, perhaps, or a zombie, or a password stealer – you can use an exploit kit to deliver that malware to unsuspecting victims.


With Angler, attackers can outsource the job of booby-trapping web pages and 

Visitors to these booby-trapped sites - known as landing pages - are redirected to a website that hosts the Angler exploit kit. Angler then attempts to exploit known vulnerabilites (in Flash, Silverlight, Java, JavaScript...) to infect the target with malware. 



The entire process can occur completely invisibly, requiring no user action.
