= Save running-configuration file on a Cisco router

When you make changes to the configuration settings on a Cisco router, the settings are saved to the running-config, which is stored in volatile RAM.

The problem with this is that when the router loses power - say, when it is rebooted - all the settings will be lost. To avoid this, the running-config must be copied to the startup-config.

We do this from Privileged EXEC Mode:
	Router# copy running-config startup-config

This copies the running-config (volatie RAM) to the startup-config (non-volatile RAM / NVRAM). You can now reset the router without losing 

To confirm that the settings were saved to the startup-config, you can use the priviledged EXEC command:
	Router# show startup-config 

The show command displays the startup-config on screen, which is useful to verify settings and to ensure there are no unencrypted passwords in the config file.
