= Hospitals hit by 'Locky' ransomware

The Methodist Hospital in Henderson, Kentucky, had to declare an internal state of emergency on Tuesday after the ransomeware 'Locky' got onto its network through an attachement to a spam email. From that first infection, the ransomeware spread across the network, encrypting files and emails.

The hospital, one of three hit by ransomeware in the past week, scrambled to restore access to encrypted files and emails. Desktops were turned off and brought back one at a time to ensure they were infection-free.  

At time of writing it is unclear whether the hospital ended up paying the $1,600 ransom, but an attorney for the hospital told link:http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/03/hospital-declares-internet-state-of-emergency-after-ransomware-infection/[Krebs on Security] that handing over the four Bitcoins had not been ruled out.
