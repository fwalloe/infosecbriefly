= How to: set Message Of The Day (MOTD) on a Cisco router

In Global Configuraton Mode, type: 

 banner motd the #message of the day#

The first character after _motd_ becomes the delimiter, which we use to set the start and end of the message. This example uses the hashtag # as the delimiter. 

When a user tries to access the router they will see the message:

 message of the day

Note that any character can be used as the delimiter, provided that it only appears at the start and end of the message.
